        'BREAKING NEWS: Our sources tell us that Zeus was having an affair with a young girl named Io! It seems as though she was reluctant to participate in the scandal but Zeus beguiled her with his power and money to the point where she had no choice! However, Zeus needs to fear no legal persecution. His legal defense team has fought off countless charges in the past, and this is no different. What\'s more, our sources tell us that his wife Hera found out and tortured the young girl! From what we know, Zeus and Io were at a five-star hotel, but Hera found out! It looks like she has hired private investigators to follow Zeus around. When she entered the hotel room, Zeus, who realized she was coming, hid Io in the bedroom closet. Hera ordered one of her bodyguards to shoot their weapon through the closet unless Zeus confesses the truth! After a few tense seconds, Zeus gives in. He begs his wife to let Io go, and Hera abides, as long as Zeus promises not to cheat on her again. The couple returned to their secluded mansion, and Io, received many gifts from Zeus, as an apology for his wife\'s wrath. - Source: Ovid',
        'BREAKING NEWS: Poor Apollo adds another heartbreak to his list of doomed relationships! Just recently, Apollo was known to be intimate with a man named Hyacinthos. But yesterday, their relationship ended in tragedy, after Hyacinthos ended up in the hospital. Our sources say that the (ex) couple were out in the field playing discus. In fact, Apollo was teaching Hyacinthos to throw the discus. As Apollo threw the discus up into the air, a strong burst of wind altered the discus\' flight and struck Hyacinthos in the back! Apollo rushed him to a hospital and he suffered a direct hit to his upper spine. Unfortunately, this incident left him paralyzed from the neck down. Despite Apollo\'s great experience working in the hospital, he could not help his beloved. The last words Hyacinthos told Apollo was that he never wants to see him again. Ouch! This comes just after Apollo\'s previous relationship with Daphne, where she changed cities to get away from him as she couldn\'t stand him! Poor Apollo! - Source: Lucian',
        'BREAKING NEWS: The world-famous engineer, Hephaestus, caught his supermodel wife cheating! What\'s more, she didn\'t cheat on just anyone. It was the military general Ares! Sources say this was not a one-time affair, but had been going on for quite some time. When Hephaestus was forced to work late at the Tesla factory, Aphrodite and Ares would be spending the night together, in his bed! Quite scandalous! One day, their neighbour Helios caught Ares leaving the house in the morning and told Hephaestus of the situation. Hephaestus, filled with seething rage, designed tiny micro cameras, almost invisible to the naked eye, and placed them around his house. He told his wife that he was going to be working late that day. To no one\'s surprise, Ares and Aphrodite decided to spent the evening together. Later that night, Hephaestus showed up to catch his wife red-handed! Looking for vengeance, Hephaestus took the clips recorded by the camera and posted it all over the internet in an effort to smear the reputations of Aphrodite and Ares. To his dismay, this only increased Aphrodite\'s popularity. Hephaestus, still in love, could not bare to file for divorce. - Source: Homer']
